# IMPLEMENTIA

Welcome to the Implementia project! This README will guide you through the necessary steps to set up and run the project locally.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Django (3.x)
- Django REST Framework
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muneeb787/proj-implementai.git
   ```

2. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment (if created):

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     env\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```
4. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd proj-implementai
   ```

5. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
## Database Setup

1. Migrate database schema:

   ```bash

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The server will start running locally at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` by default.
